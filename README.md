## HoriSEOn Refactor Challenge

This challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS code of the Horiseon webpage to make it accessible, being sure to follow the "Scout Rule", which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it, especially when working with someone else's code.

This challenge required improving the HTML semantic elements. It required the combining of  CSS selectors. Comments were inlcuded before each section to explain the changes that were made.

During this challenge, I came across many difficulties in pushing my code to GitHub. Once I created a local folder to "house my work" it was easier to locate my html, css, images, etc., and push to GitHub. 
Another challenge I came across was understanding the difference between different HTML semantic elements. After speaking with my tutor, I was able to discern which semantic elements to use.
It was easier to look at the HTML code in "sections" to understand where it related on the website. Being able to visual this made it easier to refactor the code.



## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
